# Privacy Policy – Melee Uruguay GPT Proxy

Last updated: 2026-02-21

This service acts as a proxy between a Custom GPT assistant and the Start.gg tournament platform in order to verify player attendance and placements in Melee Uruguay MMM league tournaments.

## What data is processed

The only user-provided data that may be transmitted through this service is:

- A player tag (gamerTag), used to check whether a player attended a specific tournament event.

No personal identifying information such as real names, email addresses, IP addresses, or account credentials is collected or stored by this service.

## How the data is used

The player tag is used solely for the purpose of:

- Querying publicly available tournament bracket data from Start.gg
- Verifying whether a player attended a specific event
- Retrieving the placement of that player in the event standings

This information is used only to provide statistical responses about participation and performance in Melee Uruguay MMM league tournaments.

## Data storage

This proxy does not store or retain any user input or tournament query results.

All requests are processed in real time and discarded after the response is returned.

## Third-party services

Tournament attendance and placement data are retrieved from Start.gg via its official GraphQL API.

Start.gg’s own privacy practices and policies apply to any data they process.

## Contact

If you have any questions about this policy, please contact the Melee Uruguay league organizers.
